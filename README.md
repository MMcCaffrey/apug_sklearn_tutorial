# Scikit-learn tutorial for the Austin Python Meetup group

This is a very short tutorial on scikit-learn, and only covers very simple classification and cross-validation. You can find much more complete tutorials at the following links, among others:

- [Official tutorial](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)
- [Scipy conference](https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2016-sklearn)
- [Pycon](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_tutorial)

To run the notebook in this tutorial, you will need the following packages installed:

- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

I recommend the anaconda python distribution, which comes with all of the above pre-loaded.
